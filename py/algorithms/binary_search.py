    """This algorithm represents the iterative low bound binary search
    algorithm. If the target element is present in the array, the index
    returned will represent the first time that element occurred inside the
    array.

    This algorithm finds the position of a target value within within a sorted
    array by dividing a range of values into halves, and continuing to narrow
    down the search space until the desired value is found. As such, it is an
    example of a divide and conquer algorithm.

    This algorithm assumes the simplest case of binary search searching over an
    explicit sorted array, but the search space can be any space that is sorted.

    For example, binary search can be used on functions which are monotonically
    increasing  or decreasing in order to find the lowest possible value some
    condition is met (low bound binary search), or the highest possible value
    some condition is met (high bound binary search).

    This means binary searching over the inputs of these functions to determine
    which input produces the most optimal value (ie: the highest or lowest
    output value that meets some condition).

        Integer representing the idx at which the target value occurs, or -1 if
        it does not occur
